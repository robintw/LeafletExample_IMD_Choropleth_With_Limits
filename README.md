# Example Choropleth map with custom limits
This is an example of a choropleth map in Leaflet, using the leaflet-choropleth package with my extension to add the ability to use custom limits.

See this [blog post](http://blog.rtwilson.com/setting-limits-for-a-choropleth-layer-manually-with-leaflet-choropleth) for more details, and view the map at [https://robintw.github.io/LeafletExample_IMD_Choropleth_With_Limits/](https://robintw.github.io/LeafletExample_IMD_Choropleth/)
